# KubeBridge 🚀

KubeBridge is a hands-on Kubernetes platform project that demonstrates how containerized applications are deployed, exposed, and managed using real-world DevOps and cloud-native practices.

This project focuses on understanding **Kubernetes networking, ingress traffic flow, and operational troubleshooting**, rather than just deploying a demo app.
